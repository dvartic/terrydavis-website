# Terry A. Davis Tribute Website.
This website is a simple, TempleOS inspired website made as a tribute to Terry A. Davis.
## Who is Terry?
He was a programmer mostly known for TempleOS. Terry built everything on TempleOS from scratch, including programming language, editor, compiler and kernel. Terry was very talented, but unfortunately he suffered from schizophrenia and this impacted his life severely.
## Included in the website:
* A home page with an introduction.
* A biography page with a summary and the best resources (imho) that are useful to understand Terry's life.
* A TempleOS page with an overview of the OS and more resources.
* A "GodSays" page that includes a port of his GodSays/GodSpeak program (clientside). More information: https://github.com/dvartic/godsays-godspeak-clientside-js
## Why I made this website:
Terry was an inspiration to many including myself and I found that information is currently a bit scattered.
